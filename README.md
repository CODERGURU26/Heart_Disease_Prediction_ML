❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early prediction can help in timely diagnosis and treatment.
This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical and demographic data.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze patient health data

Build and evaluate machine learning models

Predict the presence of heart disease with good accuracy

Demonstrate the application of ML in healthcare
